## Mor Naaman -- Advisor PhD "Syllabus"

While we give explicit guidance to our students in the classroom via our syllabi, we don’t do that for our PhD students.  This document is meant to capture the expected experience -- with its requirements and offerings, benefits and drawbacks  --  of a PhD student _working with me as an advisor, as part of my lab at Cornell Tech_.

The document borrows heavily from [Eric Gilbert’s PhD syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11D3kHElzS2HQxTwPqcaTnU5HCJ8WGE5brTXI4KLf4dM/edit#), and takes inspiration (and some text) from Sarita Yardi Schoenebeck's [note about student advising](http://yardi.people.si.umich.edu/advising.html) and others. While I often borrowed their ideas and many of Eric's own words (with [permission](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1)), I stand behind the text in this document, which, in this instance, only represents my own views, practices, and attitudes. I encourage you to refer to their notes for their thoughtful texts and more comprehensive cover of some of the topics. For example, this document focuses on the technical aspects of a PhD, while Eric's notes touch more deeply on some of the more, let's say, existential questions around this experience, as well as adding some tips about PhD topics like giving talks. Eric's syllabus also provides pointers to other sources of PhD advice.

This is intended as a living document. I will both update it as new topics that represent a significant part of the PhD experience arise; and as a response to feedback from advisees and others over time, both about the text and the guidelines expressed in it. As with all guidance you get in academia, take caution when applying it to your situations and contexts. You should also view this document as complementary to the Cornell doctoral student resources and guidelines. The Cornell PhD programs pages in [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/phd) and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd) also have useful information and advice; if these pages have any information that contradicts my notes below, they are to be believed first.
